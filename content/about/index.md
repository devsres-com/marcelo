**DevSREs Network Initiative** founder, Marcelo Andrade, is a Linux and free software enthusiast since the first Conectiva Parolin version from 1997.

Over the years, he's donned with proud several names commonly attributed to IT professionals who do not work directly with software development: sysop, sysadmin, network administrator, network analyst, infrastructure analyst, support analyst, solutions engineer... And now, self indudging himself with the title of **Site Reliability Engineer**. 

The truth is, in all of them, the focus is always the same: **maintaining online environments, ensuring performance, scalability and reliability** to the company's systems. What changes over the years is the approach and the toolsets used.

Main works are directed towards on-premisses [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters installation and configuration, altogether with several other [Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io/) technologies (and some other ones that aren't so much).
